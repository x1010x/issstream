# ISS Stream

ISS Stream is a web application that displays the current position of the International Space Station (ISS) on a map. It fetches the ISS position data from an API and updates the map in real-time, providing users with an interactive way to track the ISS's orbit around the Earth.

# Features

## Real-time ISS Position Tracking 

The application fetches the latest ISS position data from an API and updates the map every second, allowing users to see the ISS's current location and track its movement.

## City Data Integration 
The application includes a list of cities from around the world, which are displayed on the map. This feature allows users to see the ISS's position relative to major cities, providing additional context and making it easier to understand the ISS's location.
